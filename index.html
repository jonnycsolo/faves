        2013 was the year of the sharing economy.  From <a href="http://www.airbnb.com">AirBnB</a> to these ride-sharing services, why not bypass the traditional way of doing things to save money and have a novel experience?

          Is Chicago the new Silicon Valley? If not, its because we work much harder! Between <a href="http://www.1871.com">1871<a/>, <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a>, and the birth of a new startup nearly every 24 hours, Chicago is putting itself on the map as place to do business in the 21st Century!

           2013 became the year that you could <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1001052821">buy your own 3D printer</a> for less than the price of a brand-new Macbook Pro.  I think it is amazing that this technology is now available to anyone who wants to learn how to use it.

            Love or Hate the guy, Steve Jobs had a tremendous impact on the way you interact with technology.  I enjoyed this take on the life of Apple's co-founder, and seeing this movie gave me the final push to join Starter School. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/871521-here-s-to-the-crazy-ones-the-misfits-the-rebels-the">Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</a>

          Bitcoin doesn't get all of the spotlight anymore. Litecoin, Bitcoin's brother developed by ex-googler Charlie Lee (now working at Coinbase) has had an equally impressive run and has demonstrated there is room for more than one coin in this eco-system.  There is even a coin <a href="http://coinyeco.in/">for Kanye West</a>.
